			<div class="factstext">
					<p class="ftext"> The ACA is meant to “provide affordable, quality health care for all Americans and reduce the growth in healthcare spending, and for other purposes.” The Health Insurance Exchange Marketplace opened Oct 1st, 2013. The health insurance exchanges, or ObamaCare exchanges, are online marketplaces for health insurance. Americans can use their state’s “Affordable” Insurance Exchange (marketplace) to obtain coverage from competing private health care providers. Shoppers can use a price calculator to see if they qualify for cost assistance subsidies (as well as Medicaid and CHIP) and see side-by-side comparisons of qualified health plans ensuring the best deal for them and their family.</p>

				<div class="obamalist"> 

					<div class="list"> Before ACA </div>
					<br>
					<ul> 
						<li> -- A PBS report stated that 44 million Americans did not have Health Insurance. Part of this is due to the extraordinary costs of quality health insurance in the US. HealthCare reform would serve as a means to have these Americans have access to health care. </li>
						<br>
						<li> -- Insurance companies were able to deny you for pre-existing conditions or drop you when you got sick. After 2014 you can no longer be denied coverage or treatment based on health status. </li>
						<br>
						<li> -- Millions of people were (and continue to be) too poor to afford health insurance, yet make too much to qualify for Medicaid. </li>
						<br>
						<li> -- Before the ACA, preventative measures and wellness visits were not covered adequately. </li>
						<br>
						<li> -- Some of America’s largest firms didn’t offer health benefits. </li>

					<div class="thirdsectext"> The Current 2016 enrollment numbers: The current enrollment numbers (as of February 2016) are roughly: 12.7 million in the marketplace, and very roughly 20 million total between the ACA between the Marketplace, Medicaid expansion, young adults staying on their parents plan, and other coverage provisions. </div>

				 	<div class="untext"> The 2016 uninsured rate remains at an all time low with the uninsured rate at 11.9% for Americans 18 – 64 and 8.6% for all Americans. 8.6% is down from 9.1% as of 4th quarter 2015, and 15.7% before the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. TIP: The census says 11.9% for Q1 2016, a Gallup poll featured above says 11.4% Q1 2015, they are different studies looking at the same demographic. Marketplace signups didn’t see a net increase for 2016 (although many re-enrolled for the 12.7 million total enrolled), gains were made in other insurance types. </div>
